*This repository contains a series of C programs demonstrating file handling and data processing concepts. Task 1 introduces basic file operations, showing how to open, read, write, and close files. Task 2 builds on this by performing data manipulation such as sorting, calculations, or modifications using arrays and loops. Task 3 adds user interaction, allowing dynamic input alongside file data, illustrating how programs can handle both static and runtime information. Task 4 covers advanced file handling techniques, including managing multiple files, appending data, creating new output files, structured output formatting, and error handling. Together, these tasks provide a progressive understanding of file operations, data processing, and program flexibility in C*.
